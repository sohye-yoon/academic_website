### Academic Website

A simple jekyll template for an academic website. Main features:

- lets you centralize co-author management; 
- the copyright year is automatically updated;
- looks OK on a cell phone
- easy to host on [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/)

#### Getting started:
The only files/folders you need to customize are:

- _config.yml
- index.md
- research.md
- white_papers.md (if you don't have white papers, remove the corresponding
 menu entry in /_data/menu.yml)
- /assets/resume.pdf (don't change the name)
- /assets/papers/  (put your papers there)
- /images/
